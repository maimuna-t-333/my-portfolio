                    Hello! I'm <span class="font-semibold ">Maimunah Tabassum</span>, a passionate Frontend Developer with a strong focus on writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code. I specialize in building dynamic and responsive web applications using modern JavaScript frameworks like React. I enjoy transforming complex problems into elegant, user-friendly solutions. Whether it's implementing REST APIs, optimizing performance, or designing intuitive interfaces, I am committed to delivering high-quality code that meets both user needs and business goals. I am constantly exploring new technologies such as Mongodb, express.js to stay ahead in the rapidly evolving web development landscape. Collaboration and continuous learning are at the heart of my approachâ€”I love working with cross-functional teams and contributing to open-source projects whenever possible. My ultimate goal is to create digital experiences that are not only visually appealing but also performant and accessible to everyone.
